3. Run "FastActivate.exe"
4. Use menu buttons for what you need. See menu items help.
5. Done...

### Menu Items Help
 
Here is a brief explanation of each menu item:

- **Update meta.txt:** Update latest meta.txt. (if servers are not down) You need to allow wget.exe in your firewall if asked. If you have a new meta code which is not in the integrated or updated meta.txt (See in program for date of current integrated meta.txt) then you must put all new meta codes in a file named META.TXT and copy it to the Device/SD-Card ROOT Directory or keep it in the same directory as FastActivate.exe.
- **Patch Maps, Voices, Speedcams and Fuel Prices:** Patch ALL these in your device. If you get a ".dct ERROR" message, it usually means the meta has not been released.
- **Patch Navcore (ttsystem or PNDNavigator):** Patch Your Navcore with this which is needed to use patched maps. Wait and it will tell you when done.
- **Patch TomTom HOME:** This works automatically and there is no need to search for any files, just wait and it will tell you when done. If you use this you first need to use TomTom HOME "Operate my Device" option; this will download your profile files; then close HOME and patch it.
- **RunMeForCode (Create a meta/blowfish code from genuine map):** You can create meta code with this button...you have to be the original owner of the map. Remember... meta data does NOT contain any personal information from you or your device. It is safe to share.
- **Update QuickGPSfix (Fix your GPS position):** Your TomTom device uses the signals of at least 4 satellites to find out where you are. To start navigating, it needs to know exactly where each satellite is. So start your journey faster with TomTom QuickGPSfix button
- **My Device Info:** This is just info from your device which others need if you ask for help (on most forums).
- **Android Activation:** Use this button on Android device with patched .apk.
